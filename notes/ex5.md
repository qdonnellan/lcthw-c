Operators that are new to me:

Bitwise operators, [this wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) has some good explanations.

`XOR` means "exclusive or", or "If A or B but not both A and B". For bitwise `XOR` that means `1 and 0` or `0 and 1` but not `1 and 1` or `0 and 0`.
