The `cc` compiler flag `-Wall` is "Show all warnings"

Changing `%d` to `%s` for age results in a "Segmentation fault: 11" when the code is run

If you set age to `10.1` but still keep the `%d` it actually only shows `10` (the `.1` is left off)

List of escape sequences can be found here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequences_in_C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequences_in_C). My favorite is the beep `\a`!
